Interpreting residual plots from linear regression can be difficult to
learn because it is more of an art than a skill. Let’s walk through some
examples where we generate data that violates an assumption in linear
regression and see what the residual plots look like. By then end, we
should have an idea of the common residual patterns to look for and what
assumptions they might violate.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
```

# Introduction

We often refer to residual plots to check that our assumptions are
reasonable when performing linear regression. We will demonstrate what
residuals look like when these assumptions are not met.

``` r
# define some plotting functions

plot_lm = function(data) {
  return(
    data %>%
      ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = "y ~ x")
  )
}

plot_resid = function(data) {
  return(
    data %>%
      ggplot(aes(x, resid)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
  )
}
```

# Equal Variance

Let’s create some data where the equal variance assumption is violated.

``` r
# draw x's uniformally over interval [0, 10]
x = runif(100, min = 0, max = 10)

# assign y's as linear function of x's with some noise that depends on the value of x
y = x + x*rnorm(100)

uneq_var = tibble(x, y)
plot_lm(uneq_var)
```

Now, we fit a linear model with this data and look at the residuals.

``` r
uneq_var_lm = lm(y ~ x, data = uneq_var)

uneq_var %>%
  add_residuals(uneq_var_lm) %>%
  plot_resid()
```

![](/rmd_figs/uneq_var_resid-1.png)

We can clearly see that the residuals around *x* = 0 are much less
dispersed than the residuals around *x* = 10. When the equal variance
assumption is violated, we typically see a “funnel” shape to the
residuals.

# Normal Error

Let’s create some data where the normal error assumption is violated.

``` r
# we will use the same x's as before

# assign y's as linear function of x's with uniform error
y = x + runif(100, min = -5, max = 5)

unif_err = tibble(x, y)
plot_lm(unif_err)
```

![](/rmd_figs/unif_err-1.png)

Now, we fit a linear model with this data and look at the residuals.

``` r
unif_err_lm = lm(y ~ x, data = unif_err)

unif_err %>%
  add_residuals(unif_err_lm) %>%
  plot_resid()
```

![](/rmd_figs/unif_err_resid-1.png)

This is what the error looks like with uniform error. Let’s also look at
a more extreme example where we either have error 1 or -1.

``` r
# use the same x's as before

# assign y's as linear function of x's with error of -1 or 1
y = x + rbinom(10, 1, .5) * 2 -1

binom_err = tibble(x, y)
plot_lm(binom_err)
```

![](/rmd_figs/binom_err-1.png)

``` r
binom_err_lm = lm(y ~ x, data = binom_err)

binom_err %>%
  add_residuals(binom_err_lm) %>%
  plot_resid()
```

![](/rmd_figs/binom_err_resid-1.png)

Now we can see the error is definitely not normally distributed. If it
were, there would be more observations close to 0.

# Independence

It is not always possible to determine if the independence assumption
isn’t met by looking at residual plots. However, we will show one
example where we can.

``` r
# create some normal error
error = rnorm(100)

# create data frame where we add normal error to x's
add_error = tibble(x, y = x + error)

# create data frame where we subtract normal error to x's
subtract_error = tibble(x, y = x - error)

# combine these data frames. Note that we used each x twice so we do not have independent observations
dependent = bind_rows(add_error, subtract_error)
plot_lm(dependent)
```

![](/rmd_figs/dependent-1.png)

Now let’s look at the residuals.

``` r
dependent_lm = lm(y ~ x, data = dependent)

dependent %>%
  add_residuals(dependent_lm) %>%
  plot_resid()
```

![](/rmd_figs/dependent_resid-1.png)

Note that the error is symmetrical about zero.

# Nonlinearity

Finally, we’ll make some data where the relationship is not linear.

``` r
# use the same x's as before

# assign y's as quadratic function of x's with normal error
y = x^2 + rnorm(100)

non_lin = tibble(x, y)
plot_lm(non_lin)
```

![](/rmd_figs/non_lin-1.png)

Now let’s look at the residuals.

``` r
non_lin_lm = lm(y ~ x, data = non_lin)

non_lin %>%
  add_residuals(non_lin_lm) %>%
  plot_resid()
```

![](/rmd_figs/non_lin_resid-1.png)

As we can see, the residuals follow a very clear quadratic pattern.
